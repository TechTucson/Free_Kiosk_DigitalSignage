# Puppy Linux Setup 

- While we'll be using Virtual Box the intent here is to use readily available hardware to create these kiosks.
- This article will not go into the specifics of installing or using VirtualBox. 
  
#### Step 1 Download Puppy Linux
- At the moment of writing this article we are using PuppyLinux JammyPup32( Ubuntu+Debian Base) The direct link to the ISO we used is here: https://sourceforge.net/projects/pb-gh-releases/files/JammyPup32_release/JammyPup32-22.04-240309.iso/download
- The latest or other PuppyLinux ISO's can be found here: https://forum.puppylinux.com/puppy-linux-collection
#### Step 2 Create a VirtualBox  
- We won't need many resources. As a test: I am using **1GB Memory**, **1 CPU**, and **8GB** Hard Drive (Though Only 1.5 GB Are Being Used)
- Start The Virtual Machine
#### Step 3 Create A Fat 32 Partition ( To Install Puppy Linux)
