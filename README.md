# Free_Kiosk_DigitalSignage

This project is aimed at the small and even midsize locations that want to push out digital signage without the costs. At the essence of DigitaSignance, you have Media and you have a Player. This project will scaffold various subprojects with an intent to have a fully working centrally managed solution. Here are the current thoughts behind the sub-projects:

## Requirements

- Basic Linux Understandment
- Basic Scripting ( Bash/Python/PHP)
  - This does not go very deep.  

## Sub Project 1 ( V1)
This should get you up and running with displaying Media to a Screen. You'll be able to choose wether you want to display Images, Videos, or an External Site. 

### Piece1
