- We'll need two (2) Kiosks Machines, one (1) Server.
- All three (3) need to be conected using a Internal Network.
  - Give them static IPs. Within our Lab we'll be using:
    -  10.10.10.10 Sever
    -  10.10.10.20 Kiosk 1
    -  10.10.10.30 Kiosk 2
  -  Make sure you can SSH into the kiosks machines
